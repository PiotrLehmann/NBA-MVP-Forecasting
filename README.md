# NBA MVP Forecasting
## Description

## Dataset

## Results
As a result of training various models and identifying the most effective one, forecasts for the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) were generated for each season since the year 2000 [➡️ To this file](documents/best_model_prediction_results.pdf), where green color means right prediction / red means bad prediction of MVP. In addition, the remaining four MVP contenders were also predicted in order to later compare the results with predictions made by the NBA organization itself.
Results reached:
- 86.9% accuracy in prediction of MVP only,
- 81.7% in prediction of top 5 favourites for MVP race
 Additionally, after performing the final prediction for the 2024–2025 season (on December 6, 2024, while the season was still ongoing), the model's effectiveness was confirmed by selecting the same MVP favorite as the one chosen by the NBA experts or official NBA model — as shown in the image below.
